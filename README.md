GATO - Gamedev Auxiliary TOol
====

  GATO mostly sits on your taskbar, wasting a few resources and looking pretty. Occasionally it may turn out to be useful (like it's namesake).
  Right clicking on it will display a list of shell tasks, which are read from a yaml file. These tasks can be quite useful for game development and may include:
  * Link to your Issues page
  * Go to your current project's wiki
  * Pull changes from several repositories
  * Open your entire work toolset 
  * Setup a newly-formated PC for work
  * etc

Dev Notes
========

This is meant to be used by non-programmers and should be the most intuitive thing ever to use.
